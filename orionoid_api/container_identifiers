Container Identifiers
Search for a list of SHA1 hashes and segment IDs of torrent and nzb containers. This function is a combination of the container hash and segment functions. More details can be found under the hash and segment sections.

Hashes are already returned from the stream search endpoint and there is no need to make an additional request to this endpoint to retrieve them. This endpoint is only for retrieving details of torrents and nzbs that were not retrieved from Orion, but from some external scraper.

Requests are subject to the user's daily hash limit.
