Container Hashes
Search for a list of torrent and nzb container SHA1 hashes.

Hashes are already returned from the stream search endpoint and there is no need to make an additional request to this endpoint to retrieve them. This endpoint is only for retrieving details of torrents and nzbs that were not retrieved from Orion, but from some external scraper.

Requests are subject to the user's daily hash limit.
