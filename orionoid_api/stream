Stream Search
Search for a list of stream links.

Note that in addition to the number of retrieved streams deducted from the user's daily link limit, the debridlookup, filematch, and sort=best options might subtract additional points from the limit. Each of these parameters has a weighted contribution to the daily link limit, depending on the complexity of the task. Hence, if 100 links are retrieved, more than 100 points might be deducted from the limit if these features are utilized. If you decide to incorporate these options, consider allowing users to disable them in your app settings.

Requests are subject to the user's daily link limit.

fr,es,en
The language of the streams to sort by which places streams with the preferred language at the start of the list. Streams with an audio track in the first provided language are placed first, followed by streams with subtitles in that language, followed by the second provided language, and so on. If true is passed as a value, the languages from filelanguages / audiolanguages / subtitlelanguages will be used for sorting instead. This attribute can be used together with sortvalue, which will first sort by language and then sort internally by another attribute. More results will be returned when using sortlanguages, compared to using filelanguages / audiolanguages / subtitlelanguages which removes streams from the results which do not match the language.
popularitypercent
No
Float
[0,1]
0.8
The minimum popularity percentage of streams. Popularity is determined by the number of users who access the stream. The percentage is calculated as a relative measurement to the popularity of other streams for the given movie or show.
popularitycount
No
Integer
[0,∞]
2452
The minimum popularity count of streams. Popularity is determined by the number of users who access the stream. The count is an absolute measurement. For a finer or relative measurement, the percentage should be used instead.

direct,premiumize
The access status of the stream. Only streams that are cached with a debrid service, direct hoster links that do not require an account, or indirect hoster links that require an account or URL resolver, are returned. The cached access status can be checked for all or specific stream types, namely torrents, usenet, and hosters.
debridlookup
No
Selection
all / user / premiumize / offcloud / torbox / debrider / easydebrid / realdebrid / debridlink / alldebrid
premiumize,realdebrid
Do a fresh cache lookup on the debrid server to determine the current cache status. If no lookup is done, the previously known cache status is returned instead. The all options retrieves the cache status for all debrid services, whereas the user option only retrieves the cache status of debrid services authenticated by the user. Note that using this option will increase the duration of the API request. Users should authorize their debrid account on Orion's website.
debridresolve
No
Selection
user / premiumize / offcloud / torbox / debrider / easydebrid / realdebrid / debridlink / alldebrid / list / choice / link / redirect / original / stream / sequential / ip
premiumize,123.45.67.89
Add resolving debrid links to the results. The streaming link is only added as a debrid attribute to the results if the user has at least one debrid account authenticated with Orion. If this link is visited, Orion resolves the link with a debrid service and automatically redirects to the debrid file for immediate downloading or streaming. This feature is useful if your app does not have its own debrid functionality. If the value of this parameter is set to user, the first available debrid service authenticated by the user is automatically selected. Alternatively, you can specify the debrid service of choice. More information on the options can be found under the Debrid Resolve endpoint documentation.

filename
No
Selection
true / false / list
hdr,-dv
The file name of the stream. If set to true, only streams with a file name will be retrieved. If set to false, only streams without a file name will be retrieved. Alternatively, a comma-separated list of keywords that must match the file name can be passed. Keywords starting with a - are excluded, otherwise they are included. All keywords are ANDed together in lowercase, hence all of the included keywords and none of the excluded keywords must be present in the file name. Note that this matches any substring in the file name, not only full words. Hence, "en" will not only match the English language code, but also any word that contains the substring "en", like "french". Spaces and other special characters have to be URL-encoded. For more advanced file name matching, use the filematch parameter.
filematch
No
String
(hdr|dv|dolby.?vision)
Match the file name of the stream against a custom regular expression. Expressions have to be URL-encoded. A detailed explanation of this parameter is given at the end of the API documentation. For more basic substring filtering, use the filename parameter.
